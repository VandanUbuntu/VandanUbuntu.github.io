          <li><span class='key'><br>As the planet is hit with increasingly extreme droughts, we are reminded that water is crucial to life. It is an essential resource upon which all living beings depend on and is needed to sustain social and economic development, as well as energy production and adaptation to climate change. However, we are now facing a gigantic challenge. How do we stop contaminating our rivers, seas, oceans, canals, lakes and reservoirs?  </span></li>
          <li><span class='key'><br>Eel is a Snake replica designed to spread awareness of all the pollution in our waterways. In this game you are an Eel, and the objective is to eat all the plastic/rubbish that appears in the lake. Have fun playing this game with your friends and classmates.</span></li>
